# üöÄ Bynry Backend Engineering Case Study

This repository contains my solution to the Backend Engineering Intern Case Study provided by **Bynry Inc.** It demonstrates practical backend development skills through:

- Code debugging
- Database design
- API implementation

## üß† Case Study Breakdown

### ‚úÖ Part 1: Code Review & Debugging
- Fixed missing validations
- Handled duplicate SKU checks
- Added transactional safety using rollback
- Improved response status codes

### ‚úÖ Part 2: Database Design
- Designed normalized tables for:
  - Products, Warehouses, Companies
  - Inventory, Inventory Logs
  - Suppliers (many-to-many)
  - Bundled products (recursive relation)
- Used SQLAlchemy for ORM modeling

### ‚úÖ Part 3: Low-Stock Alert API
- Returns products that are:
  - Active (recent sales)
  - Below stock threshold
- Returns supplier info and estimated days until stockout

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
- Flask (Micro web framework)
- Flask-SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- SQLite (for local development)
- Postman / Browser (for testing)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
